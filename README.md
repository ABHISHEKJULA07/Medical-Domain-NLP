# 🩺 Medical Domain Identifier using NLP & Machine Learning

---

## 📖 Overview

This project focuses on classifying patient prescriptions and clinical notes into their respective **medical specialties** (like cardiology, orthopedics, dermatology, etc.) using **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **Machine Learning**. It helps automate categorization in hospital management systems, making patient routing and document handling more efficient.

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. **Dataset**: Loads medical transcription records with labeled medical domains.
2. **Preprocessing**: Cleans text by removing punctuation, stopwords, and applies lemmatization.
3. **Feature Extraction**: Uses **TF-IDF** to convert text into numerical features.
4. **Dimensionality Reduction**: Applies **PCA** to reduce feature space and noise.
5. **Model Training**: Trains a **Random Forest Classifier** on transformed data.
6. **Prediction**: Predicts the medical domain for unseen clinical text data.

## ✅ Conclusion

This system demonstrates an effective application of NLP and machine learning to the healthcare domain. It successfully classifies medical documents based on their textual content into appropriate specialties, enabling better automation in clinical workflows. With more data and advanced models (like BERT), the system can be expanded for production-level use in hospitals and telemedicine platforms.
